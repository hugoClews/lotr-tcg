# Lord of the Rings TCG - Game Walkthrough

## 🎯 Objective

**Get your Ring-bearer (Frodo) from Site 1 to Site 9 without dying.**

That's it. Move forward, survive the Shadow player's attacks, reach Mount Doom.

Your opponent's goal: Kill your Ring-bearer or corrupt them with burden tokens before they reach the end.

## 🃏 The Two Decks in One

Every player builds ONE deck containing TWO types of cards:

| Free Peoples (Good) | Shadow (Evil) |
|---------------------|---------------|
| Your Fellowship | Your opponent plays these against YOU |
| Companions, possessions, events | Minions, conditions, shadow events |
| You play during Fellowship phase | Opponent plays during Shadow phase |

**The twist:** When YOU move forward, your OPPONENT gets twilight tokens to spawn minions against you. When THEY move, YOU get to play shadow cards against them.

---

## 💎 The Twilight Pool

The central resource that fuels the game:

```
┌─────────────────────────────────────┐
│  TWILIGHT POOL: ◆◆◆◆◆ (5)          │
└─────────────────────────────────────┘
```

**How twilight is ADDED:**
- Moving to a new site (+site's Shadow Number)
- Playing Free Peoples cards (+card's twilight cost)
- Some card abilities

**How twilight is SPENT:**
- Shadow player pays twilight to play minions
- Some card abilities remove twilight

**The tension:** Playing strong companions gives your opponent more twilight to spawn minions!

---

## 🚶 Turn Structure

Each turn follows 7 phases. The Fellowship player is "active" but both players participate.

### Phase 1: Fellowship 🏃
**Who acts:** Fellowship player (you, when moving)

What you do:
- Play companions from hand (costs twilight)
- Attach possessions/artifacts to characters
- Play Free Peoples events
- Use "Fellowship:" abilities on cards

```
Example:
You play "Legolas" (cost 4) → Add 4 twilight to pool
You attach "Elven Bow" (cost 1) → Add 1 twilight to pool
Pool now has 5 twilight for Shadow player to use
```

### Phase 2: Shadow 👁️
**Who acts:** Shadow player (opponent when you're moving)

What they do:
- Play minions by spending twilight
- Attach shadow possessions
- Play shadow conditions
- Use "Shadow:" abilities

```
Example:
Opponent plays "Moria Scout" (cost 2) → Spends 2 twilight
Opponent plays "Cave Troll" (cost 6) → Spends 6 twilight (if available)
```

**If no twilight:** Shadow player can't play minions. Safe passage!

### Phase 3: Maneuver 🎯
**Who acts:** Both players alternate

- Use "Maneuver:" special abilities
- Quick tactical plays
- Pass back and forth until both pass

### Phase 4: Archery 🏹
**Who acts:** Simultaneous

1. Count total **Archery** value on each side
2. Fellowship assigns wounds to minions
3. Shadow assigns wounds to companions

```
Example:
Legolas has "Archer" → Fellowship archery total: 1
Two Orc Archers in play → Shadow archery total: 2
Fellowship takes 2 wounds, Shadow takes 1 wound
```

### Phase 5: Assignment ⚔️
**Who acts:** Fellowship player assigns, Shadow player may override

The fellowship player decides which minions fight which companions.

**Rules:**
- Ring-bearer can only be assigned if no other companions
- Fierce minions can be assigned to Ring-bearer regardless
- Each minion must be assigned to someone (if possible)

```
Example:
Cave Troll → Assigned to Gimli
Moria Scout → Assigned to Aragorn
Nazgûl (Fierce) → Can go straight for Frodo!
```

### Phase 6: Skirmish 💥
**Who acts:** Resolve each fight one at a time

For each minion-companion pair:
1. Both players may play skirmish events
2. Compare **Strength** values
3. **Higher strength wins**
4. Loser takes wounds equal to "Damage" bonus (minimum 1)

```
┌─────────────────────────────────────┐
│  SKIRMISH                           │
│                                     │
│  Gimli (STR 6) vs Cave Troll (STR 9)│
│                                     │
│  Gimli plays "Dwarven Axe" → +2     │
│  Gimli total: 8                     │
│                                     │
│  Cave Troll wins (9 > 8)            │
│  Gimli takes 1 wound                │
└─────────────────────────────────────┘
```

**Overwhelmed:** If a companion's strength is DOUBLED, they die instantly.

### Phase 7: Regroup 🔄
**Who acts:** Both players

- Heal wounds (1 per companion at a Sanctuary)
- Discard down to hand limit (8 cards)
- Reconcile game state
- Fellowship player may MOVE AGAIN or STAY

## 🗺️ The Adventure Path

```
○───○───○───●───○───○───○───○───○
1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8   9
        ↑
    Fellowship
```

### Site Types

| Type | Effect | Example |
|------|--------|---------|
| 🏠 Sanctuary | Heal at Regroup, safe haven | Rivendell, Lothlórien |
| 🌲 Wilderness | Standard dangerous travel | Weathertop, Amon Hen |
| ⛰️ Underground | Often higher shadow numbers | Moria, Mount Doom |

### Movement

When you move:
1. Reveal next site (if face-down)
2. Add site's **Shadow Number** to twilight pool
3. Move fellowship marker forward
4. Shadow player gets to play minions!

**Double move:** After Regroup, you can choose to move AGAIN (risky but faster).

---

## ❤️ Wounds and Death

### Vitality
Each character has a **Vitality** (health) number.

```
Frodo: Vitality 4 → Can take 3 wounds, 4th kills him
Gimli: Vitality 3 → Can take 2 wounds, 3rd kills him
```

### What Causes Wounds
- Losing skirmishes
- Archery damage
- Card effects ("Wound a companion")
- Exerting (using certain abilities)

### Healing
- Sanctuary sites: Heal 1 wound per companion at Regroup
- Card effects: "Heal a companion"
- Some possessions prevent wounds

---

## 💍 The Ring-bearer & Corruption

### Burden Tokens
The Ring-bearer starts with 0 burdens. Burdens are added by:
- Wearing The One Ring
- Card effects
- Certain site effects

### Corruption Check
At certain times, you must check if Frodo is corrupted:

**Resistance** - Frodo's corruption threshold
**Burdens** - Accumulated corruption

If **Burdens ≥ Resistance** → **Frodo is corrupted. You lose.**

```
Frodo starts with Resistance 10
Each burden brings him closer to corruption
Wearing the Ring adds burdens but can save his life
```

### Wearing the Ring
The One Ring can save Frodo from wounds but:
- Adds a burden token
- Makes him a target for Nazgûl
- Some cards punish Ring-bearer for wearing it

---

### Requirements

## 💡 Strategy Tips

### As Fellowship Player
1. **Don't overcommit** - Every card you play gives Shadow twilight
2. **Time your moves** - Move to Sanctuaries when weak
3. **Protect Frodo** - He's your win condition
4. **Balance speed vs safety** - Double-moving is risky but wins games

### As Shadow Player
1. **Be patient** - Wait for big twilight pools
2. **Target weak companions** - Don't always go for Frodo
3. **Overwhelm when possible** - 2× strength = instant kill
4. **Save Nazgûl for key moments** - They're expensive but deadly

### General
- **Card advantage matters** - Drawing cards is powerful
- **Know when to concede skirmishes** - Sometimes it's okay to lose one
- **Read the board state** - Count twilight, wounds, cards in hand
- **Bluff** - Your opponent can't see your hand
